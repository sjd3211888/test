     * Access a collection of data samples from the DataReaderImpl.
     *
     * - In the case where the @ref HistoryQosPolicy::kind is KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS, the call will
     * return at most
     *   @ref HistoryQosPolicy::depth samples per instance.
     *
     * If the operation succeeds and the number of samples returned has been limited (by means of a
     * maximum limit, as listed above, or insufficient @ref SampleInfo resources), the call will
     * complete successfully and provide those samples the reader is able to return. The user may
     * need to make additional calls, or return outstanding loaned buffers in the case of
     * insufficient resources, in order to access remaining samples.
     *
     * In addition to the collection of samples, the read operation also uses a collection of @ref
     * SampleInfo structures (@c sample_infos).
     *
     * The initial (input) properties of the @c data_values and @c sample_infos collections will
     * determine the precise behavior of this operation. For the purposes of this description the
     * collections are modeled as having three properties:
     *
     * - the current length (@c len, see @ref LoanableCollection::length())
     *
     * - the maximum length (@c max_len, see @ref LoanableCollection::maximum())
     *
     * - whether the collection container owns the memory of the elements within
     *   (@c owns, see @ref LoanableCollection::has_ownership())
     *
     * The initial (input) values of the @c len, @c max_len, and @c owns properties for the @c
     * data_values and
     * @c sample_infos collections govern the behavior of the read operation as specified by the
     * following rules:
     *
     * 1. The values of @c len, @c max_len, and @c owns for the two collections must be identical.
     * Otherwise read will fail with RETCODE_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.
     *
     * 2. On successful output, the values of @c len, @c max_len, and @c owns will be the same for
     * both collections.
     *
     * 3. If the input <tt> max_len == 0 </tt>, then the @c data_values and @c sample_infos
     * collections will be filled with elements that are 'loaned' by the DataReaderImpl. On output, @c
     * owns will be @c false, @c len will be set to the number of values returned, and @c max_len
     * will be set to a value verifying <tt> max_len >= len </tt>. The use of this variant allows
     * for zero-copy access to the data and the application will need to return the loan to the
     * DataReaderImpl using the @ref return_loan operation.
     *
     * 4. If the input <tt> max_len > 0 </tt> and the input <tt> owns == false </tt>, then the read
     * operation will fail with RETCODE_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET. This avoids the potential
     * hard-to-detect memory leaks caused by an application forgetting to return the loan.
     *
     * 5. If input <tt> max_len > 0 </tt> and the input <tt> owns == true </tt>, then the read
     * operation will copy the Data values and SampleInfo values into the elements already inside
     * the collections. On output, @c owns will be @c true, @c len will be set to the number of
     * values copied, and @c max_len will remain unchanged. The use of this variant forces a copy
     * but the application can control where the copy is placed and the application will not need to
     * return the loan. The number of samples copied depends on the values of
     *    @c max_len and @c max_samples:
     *
     *    - If <tt> max_samples == LENGTH_UNLIMITED </tt>, then at most @c max_len values will be
     * copied. The use of this variant lets the application limit the number of samples returned to
     * what the sequence can accommodate.
     *
     *    - If <tt> max_samples <= max_len </tt>, then at most @c max_samples values will be copied.
     * The use of this variant lets the application limit the number of samples returned to fewer
     * that what the sequence can accommodate.
     *
     *    - If <tt> max_samples > max_len </tt>, then the read operation will fail with
     * RETCODE_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET. This avoids the potential confusion where the application
     * expects to be able to access up to
     *      @c max_samples, but that number can never be returned, even if they are available in the
     * DataReaderImpl, because the output sequence cannot accommodate them.
     *
     * As described above, upon return the @c data_values and @c sample_infos collections may
     * contain elements 'loaned' from the DataReaderImpl. If this is the case, the application will need
     * to use the @ref return_loan operation to return the loan once it is no longer using the Data
     * in the collection. Upon return from
     * @ref return_loan, the collection will have <tt> max_len == 0 </tt> and <tt> owns == false
     * </tt>.
     *
     * The application can determine whether it is necessary to return the loan or not based on the
     * state of the collections when the read operation was called, or by accessing the @c owns
     * property. However, in many cases it may be simpler to always call @ref return_loan, as this
     * operation is harmless (i.e., leaves all elements unchanged) if the collection does not have a
     * loan.
     *
     * On output, the collection of Data values and the collection of SampleInfo structures are of
     * the same length and are in a one-to-one correspondence. Each SampleInfo provides information,
     * such as the @c source_timestamp, the @c sample_state, @c view_state, and @c instance_state,
     * etc., about the corresponding sample.
     *
     * Some elements in the returned collection may not have valid data. If the @c instance_state in
     * the SampleInfo is
     * @ref vbs::NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED_INSTANCE_STATE or @ref vbs::NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS_INSTANCE_STATE, then the
     * last sample for that instance in the collection, that is, the one whose SampleInfo has <tt>
     * sample_rank == 0 </tt> does not contain valid data. Samples that contain no data do not count
     * towards the limits imposed by the
     * @ref ResourceLimitsQosPolicy.
     *
     * The act of reading a sample changes its @c sample_state to @ref vbs::READ_SAMPLE_STATE. If the
     * sample belongs to the most recent generation of the instance, it will also set the @c
     * view_state of the instance to be
     * @ref vbs::NOT_NEW_VIEW_STATE. It will not affect the @c instance_state of the instance.
     *
     * If the DataReaderImpl has no samples that meet the constraints, the operations fails with
     * RETCODE_NO_DATA.
     *
     * @em Important: If the samples "returned" by this method are loaned from the middleware (see
     * @ref take for more information on memory loaning), it is important that their contents not be
     * changed. Because the memory in which the data is stored belongs to the middleware, any
     * modifications made to the data will be seen the next time the same samples are read or taken;
     * the samples will no longer reflect the state that was received from the network.

     * Access a collection of data samples from the DataReaderImpl.
     *
     * This operation accesses a collection of data values from the DataReaderImpl where all the samples
     * belong to a single instance. The behavior is similar to @ref read_instance, except that the
     * actual instance is not directly specified. Rather, the samples will all belong to the 'next'
     * instance with @c instance_handle 'greater' than the specified 'previous_handle' that has
     * available samples.
     *
     * This operation implies the existence of a total order 'greater-than' relationship between the
     * instance handles. The specifics of this relationship are not all important and are
     * implementation specific. The important thing is that, according to the middleware, all
     * instances are ordered relative to each other. This ordering is between the instance handles,
     * and should not depend on the state of the instance (e.g. whether it has data or not) and must
     * be defined even for instance handles that do not correspond to instances currently managed by
     * the DataReaderImpl. For the purposes of the ordering, it should be 'as if' each instance handle
     * was represented as an integer.
     *
     * The behavior of this operation is 'as if' the DataReaderImpl invoked @ref read_instance, passing
     * the smallest
     * @c instance_handle among all the ones that: (a) are greater than @c previous_handle, and (b)
     * have available samples (i.e. samples that meet the constraints imposed by the specified
     * states).
     *
     * The special value @ref HANDLE_NIL is guaranteed to be 'less than' any valid @c
     * instance_handle. So the use of the parameter value @c previous_handle == @ref HANDLE_NIL will
     * return the samples for the instance which has the smallest @c instance_handle among all the
     * instances that contain available samples.
     *
     * This operation is intended to be used in an application-driven iteration, where the
     * application starts by passing @c previous_handle == @ref HANDLE_NIL, examines the samples
     * returned, and then uses the
     * @c instance_handle returned in the @ref SampleInfo as the value of the @c previous_handle
     * argument to the next call to @ref read_next_instance. The iteration continues until @ref
     * read_next_instance fails with RETCODE_NO_DATA.
     *
     * Note that it is possible to call the @ref read_next_instance operation with a @c
     * previous_handle that does not correspond to an instance currently managed by the DataReaderImpl.
     * This is because as stated earlier the 'greater-than' relationship is defined even for handles
     * not managed by the DataReaderImpl. One practical situation where this may occur is when an
     * application is iterating through all the instances, takes all the samples of a
     * @ref vbs::NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS_INSTANCE_STATE instance, returns the loan (at which point the
     * instance information may be removed, and thus the handle becomes invalid), and tries to read
     * the next instance.
     *
     * The behavior of this operation follows the same rules as the @ref read operation regarding
     * the pre-conditions and post-conditions for the @c data_values and @c sample_infos. Similar to
     * @ref read, this operation may 'loan' elements to the output collections, which must then be
     * returned by means of @ref return_loan.
     *
